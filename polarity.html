<h1>1: <em><span style="color: green">+.260</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">The bear puts both arms around the tree above her
And draws it down as if it were a lover
And its choke cherries lips to kiss good-bye,
Then lets it snap back upright in the sky.</mark></p>
<h1>2: <em><span style="color: red">-.061</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">Her next step rocks a boulder on the wall
(She's making her cross-country in the fall).</mark></p>
<h1>3: <em><span style="color: red">-.093</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">Her great weight creaks the barbed-wire in its staples
As she flings over and off down through the maples,
Leaving on one wire moth a lock of hair.</mark></p>
<h1>4: <em><span style="color: green">+.265</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Such is the uncaged progress of the bear.</mark></p>
<h1>5: <em><span style="color: #D0D0D0">.000</span></em></h1><p class="indented">The world has room to make a bear feel free;
The universe seems cramped to you and me.</p>
<h1>6: <em><span style="color: red">-.570</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">Man acts more like the poor bear in a cage
That all day fights a nervous inward rage - 
His mood rejecting all his mind suggests.</mark></p>
<h1>7: <em><span style="color: green">+.142</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">He paces back and forth and never rests
The toe-nail click and shuffle of his feet,
The telescope at one end of his beat -
And at the other end the microscope,
Two instruments of nearly equal hope,
And in conjunction giving quite a spread.</mark></p>
<h1>8: <em><span style="color: green">+.066</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Or if he rests from scientific tread,
'Tis only to sit back and sway his head
Through ninety odd degrees of arc, it seems,
Between two metaphysical extremes.</mark></p>
<h1>9: <em><span style="color: green">+.465</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">He sits back on his fundamental butt
With lifted snout and eyes (if any) shut,
(he almost looks religious but he's not),
And back and forth he sways from cheek to cheek,
At one extreme agreeing with one Greek -
At the other agreeing with another Greek
Which may be thought, but only so to speak.</mark></p>
<h1>10: <em><span style="color: red">-.237</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">A baggy figure, equally pathetic
When sedentary and when peripatetic.</mark></p>
